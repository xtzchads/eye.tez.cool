# The Eye of Chad

The Eye of Chad is a small web application that visualizes Tezos blockchain transactions flows with non-zero amounts of tez.

There are two sliders - transaction depth slider and a dust filter slider (for the case when there are too many inputs or outputs)

To explore the connection, click anywhere on a green or red node. It will trigger a new search with new address in connection (it also copied into clipboard). Tool can remember searches and move back and forward between them.

# TODO
 - Sharing searches
